# Hive Router

Hive Router is an OpenAI-compatible inference gateway with a separate admin
plane. Clients talk to one OpenAI-style endpoint; the router picks an upstream
provider, fails over when it is safe to, enforces per-key quotas, and records a
trace for every request. The admin plane serves the unified Hive console, which
also fronts Hive IAM and HiveMem when they are deployed.

It is a single Node.js process written in strict TypeScript (Hono, Prisma 7,
SQLite). The console is React + Vite and ships prebuilt in the package.

## Quick start (npm)

The easiest way to run Router, IAM and HiveMem together is the
[`@hivemagnus/hive`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hivemagnus/hive) launcher,
which writes the env files and secrets for you. To run the Router on its own:

**Requirements**

- Node.js 24 (`>=24.22.1`) or 26 (`>=26.13.0`). `better-sqlite3` installs from
  a prebuilt binary on common platforms, or compiles with a C++ toolchain.
- For console sign-in, either Linux with `pamtester` installed
  (`HIVE_ROUTER_AUTH_MODE=os`, the default: operators use their OS password),
  or a running [Hive IAM](https://github.com/ChefTaco/hive/tree/main/services/hive-iam)
  (`HIVE_ROUTER_AUTH_MODE=iam-oidc`).

**1. Write an env file**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hive && chmod 700 ~/.hive
install -m 600 /dev/null ~/.hive/router.env
echo "HIVE_ROUTER_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> ~/.hive/router.env
echo "HIVE_ROUTER_ADMIN_USERS=$USER" >> ~/.hive/router.env
```

That is the whole minimal configuration. By default the API listens on
`127.0.0.1:4020`, the console on `127.0.0.1:9443`, and the SQLite database and
traces go to `${HIVE_HOME:-~/.hive}/router` (created with mode `0700`).

**2. Check and start**

```bash
npx --allow-scripts=better-sqlite3 @hivemagnus/hive-router check --env-file ~/.hive/router.env
npx --allow-scripts=better-sqlite3 @hivemagnus/hive-router --env-file ~/.hive/router.env
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:9443/` and sign in as one of `HIVE_ROUTER_ADMIN_USERS`.
The OpenAI-compatible API is at `http://127.0.0.1:4020/v1`; both listeners
answer `GET /health`. You can also install it globally with
`npm install -g --allow-scripts=better-sqlite3 @hivemagnus/hive-router` and run `hive-router`.

**Install scripts (npm 12 and later).** The Router uses `better-sqlite3`, a
native add-on whose install script downloads (or, if none matches your
platform, builds) its binary. npm 12 blocks dependency install scripts unless
you allow them, which is what `--allow-scripts=better-sqlite3` does for `npx`
and global installs. When you add the Router to your own project, allow it in
that project's `package.json` instead (npm rejects the flag there):

```json
{ "allowScripts": { "better-sqlite3": true } }
```

Without this, the install succeeds but the Router cannot open its database.
npm 11 runs the script without asking. The `@hivemagnus/hive` launcher sets
this up for you.

**TLS.** Set `TLS_CERT_PATH` and `TLS_KEY_PATH` to a PEM certificate and key
to serve HTTPS on both listeners. TLS is required when `NODE_ENV=production`
(or `REQUIRE_TLS=true`). For a quick test certificate:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 365 -subj /CN=localhost \
  -keyout ~/.hive/router.key -out ~/.hive/router.crt
```

To expose the Router beyond this machine, also set `HOST=0.0.0.0` (or
`API_HOST`/`ADMIN_HOST`), `PUBLIC_API_URL` and `PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL`, for example
`https://hive.example.com:4020` and `https://hive.example.com:9443`.

**Commands**

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hive-router [start]` | Start the API and admin listeners (default). |
| `hive-router check [--json]` | Validate configuration: env values, TLS files, writable data directory, `pamtester` or IAM, and reachability of IAM and HiveMem when configured. Starts nothing, writes nothing, exits `1` on problems. |
| `hive-router env-schema` | Print every install-time setting as JSON (name, required, secret, default, how to generate secrets), plus ports, health path and optional dependencies. |
| `hive-router create-key --name <name>` | Create a client API key (see [API keys from the command line](#api-keys-from-the-command-line)). |
| `--env-file <path>` | Load a dotenv file first. Variables already in the environment win. Without it, `.env` and `.env.apikeys` in the working directory are read. |
| `--help`, `--version` | Usage and version. |

A missing or invalid setting stops startup with one line that names the
variable and how to fix it.

**Connecting IAM and HiveMem.** Set `HIVE_ROUTER_AUTH_MODE=iam-oidc`,
`HIVE_IAM_INTERNAL_URL` and `HIVE_ROUTER_IAM_CLIENT_SECRET` (equal to IAM's
`SEED_HIVE_ROUTER_CLIENT_SECRET`) to sign in through IAM and enable the IAM
pages. Set `HIVEMEM_INTERNAL_URL` and `HIVE_ROUTER_MEMORY_PROXY_TOKEN` for the Memory
pages. The token is a HiveMem admin token; mint it with
`hivemem-server issue-token --env-file hivemem.env --subject hive-router --role admin`
(valid for at most 30 days, so re-issue it and restart the Router before it
expires). See
[Configuration](#configuration) for everything else.

## Features

- **OpenAI-compatible API**: `/v1/models`, `/v1/responses`,
  `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, audio
  transcription/translation, image generation and moderations.
- **Many providers**: `OPENAI`, `CODEX`, `OPENAI_GENERIC`, `OPENROUTER`,
  `ANTHROPIC` (native translation), `OLLAMA` (including native `/api/*`
  passthrough), `LLAMACPP` and `VLLM` (including `/tokenize`, `/detokenize`,
  `/version`).
- **Routing**: model aliases, route rules, capability filtering, heuristic
  reranking or denial, priority/weight ranking, health checks and circuit
  breaking. An optional adaptive mode leans toward providers that have been
  faster and more reliable recently. Routing configuration is versioned and can
  be rolled back.
- **Safe failover**: streaming failures are classified as `pre-first-byte` or
  `mid-stream`. The router fails over only before the first token and never
  splices two upstream streams together.
- **Client API keys and quotas**: OpenAI-style `sk-...` keys, stored only as
  hashes, with daily and monthly request and token caps (soft warnings, then
  hard `429`s).
- **Observability**: per-request traces (body capture is configurable),
  Prometheus metrics, optional OpenTelemetry export, estimated usage when the
  provider does not report it, and an audit log of admin actions.
- **Model discovery**: `POST /api/providers/:id/discover` pulls live model
  lists into the catalog and keeps any operator overrides.
- **Admin console**: provider and routing editors, traces, incidents, API keys,
  audit, and (when configured) IAM and Memory pages, all behind PAM or IAM
  OIDC login.
- **Shadow decision model (optional)**: classifies prompts with the TypeSafe
  Jev decision API (with OpenRouter as fallback) and records the result on the
  trace without changing routing.

## Architecture

```
clients ──► API plane (API_HOST:API_PORT) ──► providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, ...)
                     │
                     └─ traces, metrics, quotas ─► SQLite (DATABASE_URL)

operators ─► Admin plane (ADMIN_HOST:ADMIN_PORT)
               ├─ Hive console (static SPA)
               ├─ /api/*            admin API (session cookie + permission checks)
               ├─ /api/iam/*        proxied to Hive IAM with a server-side client-credentials token
               ├─ /api/memory/*     proxied to HiveMem with HIVE_ROUTER_MEMORY_PROXY_TOKEN
               └─ /v1/*, /dashboard proxied to HiveMem (compatibility paths)
```

On first start the app creates its SQLite schema. You do not need to run
`prisma db push`. The bootstrap SQL in `src/storage/generated-sqlite-schema.ts`
is generated from `prisma/schema.prisma`. Run `npm run db:generate-bootstrap`
after you edit the schema; `npm test` fails if the generated file is stale.

The IAM request types in `src/contracts/ui-api.generated.ts` are generated from the
Hive IAM OpenAPI spec. Run `npm run contracts:generate` after you change IAM request
schemas; `npm run typecheck` fails if the generated file is stale.

## Requirements (source checkout)

- Node.js 24 (`>=24.22.1`) or 26 (`>=26.13.0`) and npm
- For OS (PAM) login in production: `pamtester` on the host

## Run from a source checkout

The Prisma client is generated into `src/generated/prisma` (gitignored).
`npm run build` and `npm run typecheck` always regenerate it, and `dev`, `test`,
`cli` and the smoke scripts regenerate it when it is missing or older than
`prisma/schema.prisma` (`npm run db:generate` does it by hand). The build
compiles it into `dist/`, so the published package needs no Prisma CLI and
runs no install scripts of its own.

```bash
cd services/hive-router
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: at least HIVE_ROUTER_SECRET and HIVE_ROUTER_ADMIN_USERS
npm run build
npm run start
```

For development, run `npm run dev` (API and admin with reload) and, in another
terminal, `npm run dev:ui` (Vite dev server for the console).

`.env.example` binds the API to `https://localhost:4020` and the admin console
to `https://127.0.0.1:9443`. TLS is turned on when both `TLS_CERT_PATH` and
`TLS_KEY_PATH` point at existing files. In development, with no certificate,
the listeners use plain HTTP. Health endpoints on both listeners:
`/health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready` and `/health/dependencies`.

Next steps:

1. Sign in to the admin console as a user listed in `HIVE_ROUTER_ADMIN_USERS`.
2. Add a provider under **Providers**, for example `LLAMACPP` at
   `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with auth `NONE`.
3. Create a client key under **System → API Keys**.
4. Call the API:

   ```bash
   curl -k https://localhost:4020/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-..." -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
   ```

## Configuration

Configuration comes from environment variables. With `--env-file <path>` the
process loads that file (existing environment variables win). Otherwise it
loads `.env` from its working directory, then `.env.apikeys` if it exists,
which overrides `.env`. Relative paths are resolved against the working
directory. Variables with no default are optional unless marked **required**.
`hive-router env-schema` prints the install-time subset as JSON.

### Listeners and URLs

| `HIVE_ROUTER_DECISION_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Timeout for each decision provider call. |

## Admin access model

- **OS mode** (`HIVE_ROUTER_AUTH_MODE=os`): an allowlisted user signs in with
  their OS password, which is checked through PAM. Every OS-mode operator has
  full admin rights.
- **IAM OIDC mode** (`HIVE_ROUTER_AUTH_MODE=iam-oidc`): the router signs the user
  in against Hive IAM with authorization code + PKCE, then checks the username
  against `HIVE_ROUTER_ADMIN_USERS`. IAM `admin` and `super_admin` roles grant
  full access. Other users need a permission for each request, reads included:
  for example `router:providers:read` or `router:providers:write`,
  `iam:users:read`, `memory:read`. Any `:write` grant also covers the matching
  `:read`. Exporting the configuration requires `router:settings:write`.
- Credential and policy changes need a sign-in from the last 15 minutes. The
  console asks for the password again when needed.
- Repeated failed logins lock out that username from that client address, and
  one address that fails against many usernames is locked out too.
  Re-authentication is rate-limited in the same way.
- Browser credentials are never forwarded upstream. The IAM proxy swaps the
  admin session for a short-lived client-credentials token. The HiveMem proxy
  passes on only HiveMem's own `hivemem_*` cookies, never the router session
  cookie.
- Configuration exports never include encrypted provider secrets. When you
  import an export, providers that already exist keep their stored secrets.

## API keys from the command line

```bash
hive-router create-key --name "my-service" --metadata '{"service":"my-api","env":"prod"}'
# from a source checkout:
npm run cli -- create-key --name "my-service"
```

It uses the same configuration (and `--env-file`) as the server and writes to
the same database.

Flags: `--disabled` creates the key disabled, `--json` prints machine-readable
output, and `--token <value>` supplies `HIVE_ROUTER_CLI_TOKEN` when that is set.
The plaintext key is printed once; only a hash is stored.

## Testing

```bash
npm run typecheck          # server and UI
npm test                   # unit and integration tests (vitest)
npm run test:routing-contract
npm run build
npm run test:e2e           # Playwright console tests (builds and serves a local stack)
```

Live smoke tests against a running backend:

```bash
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 npm run smoke:ollama
LLAMACPP_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 npm run smoke:llamacpp
npm run smoke:jev          # needs HIVE_TYPESAFE_AI_KEY and/or HIVE_ROUTER_OPENROUTER_KEY
```

## Deploy

### systemd over SSH

`scripts/deploy-hive-router.sh` builds the router, uploads it over SSH, and
installs it as a systemd service with atomic releases. Code goes into
`<path>/releases/<id>`. Persistent state (database, `.env`, certificates) lives
in `<path>/shared`. The `<path>/current` link moves to the new release only
after it starts healthy. A failed start rolls back automatically, and the last
5 releases are kept.

```bash
DEPLOY_HOST=router.example.com DEPLOY_USER=deploy \
  HIVE_ROUTER_CERT_DOMAIN=router.example.com \
  bash scripts/deploy-hive-router.sh

bash scripts/deploy-hive-router.sh --dry-run              # build and package only
DEPLOY_HOST=... DEPLOY_USER=... bash scripts/deploy-hive-router.sh --rollback
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DEPLOY_HOST` (or `HIVE_ROUTER_DEPLOY_HOST`) | | **Required.** SSH host to deploy to. |
| `DEPLOY_USER` (or `DEPLOY_USERNAME`) | | **Required.** SSH user; needs sudo on the target. |
| `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` (or `HIVE_ROUTER_DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`) | | SSH private key. Without one, the script uses your SSH agent in batch mode. |
| `DEPLOY_SUDO_PASSWORD` | | Remote sudo password. Without it, the script runs `sudo -n`. |
| `DEPLOY_PASSWORD` + `DEPLOY_ALLOW_PASSWORD=true` | | Password SSH, for a one-time bootstrap only. Needs `sshpass`. |
| `HIVE_ROUTER_DEPLOY_PATH` | `/opt/hive-router` | Install root. |
| `HIVE_ROUTER_SERVICE_NAME` | `hive-router` | systemd unit name. |
| `HIVE_ROUTER_CERT_DOMAIN` | `DEPLOY_HOST` | Public FQDN the TLS certificate must match. |
| `HIVE_ROUTER_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL` | `https://<cert domain>` | Public admin URL written to the remote `.env`. |
| `HIVE_ROUTER_ADMIN_PORT` | `443` | Admin listener port on the target. |
| `HIVE_ROUTER_USE_TAILSCALE_CERT` | `false` | If you use a private network such as Tailscale, set `true` to issue the certificate with `tailscale cert`. |

When `HIVE_ROUTER_USE_TAILSCALE_CERT` is not set, the script reuses a valid
certificate in `shared/certs`. If there is none, it copies HiveMem's
certificate from the same host, or else generates a self-signed one. To use
your own certificate, place it at `shared/certs/server.crt` and `server.key`
before you deploy.

The script keeps an existing remote `.env`; pass `--reset-env` to rewrite it.
It also reads `.env` from the repository root and from this directory, so you
can keep the deploy variables there. On the target it installs `pamtester` if
it is missing. If IAM or HiveMem is installed on the same host, the script
recovers `HIVE_ROUTER_IAM_CLIENT_SECRET` from `/opt/hive-iam/.env` and
`HIVE_ROUTER_MEMORY_PROXY_TOKEN` from `/opt/hivemem/.env`.

### Docker

Build the image from the repository root:

```bash
docker build -f services/hive-router/Dockerfile -t hive-router:local .
```

`docker-compose.example.yml` publishes both listeners on loopback only. It will
not start unless you supply a strong `HIVE_ROUTER_SECRET`, an explicit
`HIVE_ROUTER_ADMIN_USERS`, and TLS certificate and key paths
(`HIVE_ROUTER_TLS_CERT_PATH`, `HIVE_ROUTER_TLS_KEY_PATH`). The container runs
as the unprivileged `node` user, so the mounted `./data` directory must be
writable by that user. The image does not include PAM, so in a container use
`HIVE_ROUTER_AUTH_MODE=iam-oidc` or provide your own
`HIVE_ROUTER_OS_AUTH_COMMAND`.

The image keeps its historical defaults, which differ from the npm package:
`API_PORT=443`, `ADMIN_PORT=9443`, `PUBLIC_API_URL=https://localhost:443`,
`PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL=https://localhost:9443`, and data under
`/repo/services/hive-router/data`. `docker-compose.example.yml` overrides the
ports and data paths.

### Production checklist

- Set `NODE_ENV=production`. The router then refuses to start without
  `TLS_CERT_PATH` and `TLS_KEY_PATH`.
- Generate `HIVE_ROUTER_SECRET` randomly (`openssl rand -hex 32`) and keep it
  out of version control.
- Set `HIVE_ROUTER_ADMIN_USERS` to the exact operators.
- Expose only the listeners you need. Bind the admin plane to a private
  interface, or put it behind a VPN or an authenticating proxy.
- Set `HIVE_ROUTER_METRICS_TOKEN` if Prometheus scrapes `/metrics`.

## Shadow decision model

Jev is a **decision model**, not a chat model. Do not configure it as an
upstream chat alias. When `HIVE_TYPESAFE_AI_KEY` or `HIVE_ROUTER_OPENROUTER_KEY`
is set and `HIVE_ROUTER_DECISION_MODE=shadow`, the router sends the prompt
fields of each text chat, completion and Responses request to TypeSafe
(`https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone`). If that call fails, it tries the
OpenRouter decisions API once. The result goes into a `jev-decision` trace
observation: a profile (`standard`, `coding`, `hard`, `internet_data`,
`dangerous`) plus injection and NSFW probabilities.

Shadow mode never rewrites, reroutes or blocks requests. Multimodal requests
and inputs larger than 24,000 bytes are skipped. Errors and timeouts are
recorded as unavailable, never as safe. Shadow calls add latency and provider
cost, and that cost does not count toward client quotas.

Offline and live evaluation tools:

```bash
npm run test:routing-contract                 # offline routing contract checks
npm run baseline:routing -- replay            # verify the recorded Jev baseline offline
npm run eval:decisions                        # live evaluation against synthetic fixtures
EVAL_PROVIDER=llamacpp LLAMACPP_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1 npm run eval:decisions
EVAL_PROVIDER=typesafe EVAL_LIMIT=3 npm run eval:decisions
```

The evaluation reads credentials from the repository-root `.env` (override with
`HIVE_ROUTER_EVAL_ENV_FILE`). It uses only the synthetic fixtures under
`tests/fixtures/` and writes results to `output/`. Useful knobs:
`EVAL_FIXTURES`, `EVAL_OUTPUT`, `EVAL_LIMIT`, `EVAL_REPEATS` (1–5),
`EVAL_TIMEOUT_MS`, `EVAL_MAX_TOKENS`, `LLAMACPP_MODEL`, `LLAMACPP_API_KEY` and
`LLAMACPP_THINKING=low`. See
[the routing contract](https://github.com/ChefTaco/hive/blob/main/docs/HIVEROUTER_ROUTING_CONTRACT.md) and
[the TypeSafe direct API notes](https://github.com/ChefTaco/hive/blob/main/docs/TYPESAFE_DIRECT_API.md).
