# Contributing to Hive

Thanks for your interest in improving Hive! Bug reports, documentation fixes, and pull requests are
all welcome.

## Getting set up

```bash
nvm use               # Node.js version from .nvmrc
npm run bootstrap     # install every workspace and the git hooks
npm run dev:hive      # run the full stack locally
```

The repository is a monorepo of independently locked workspaces:

| Path | Workspace |
|---|---|
| `packages/hive-contracts` | Shared Zod contracts (`@hivemem/contracts`) |
| `services/hive-router` | Model gateway and Hive console |
| `services/hive-iam` | IAM service and `@hivemem/iam-sdk` |
| `services/hive-mem` | HiveMem core, SDKs, and Hermes plugin |
| `services/hive-skills` | Skills registry |

## Before opening a pull request

Run the same gates that CI runs:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run check:openapi
npm run scan:secrets
```

- Keep TypeScript strict and follow the style of the surrounding code.
- Add or update tests for behaviour changes.
- If you change an HTTP route or schema, run `npm run generate:openapi` and commit the updated
  snapshot.
- If you change IAM request schemas, run `npm --prefix packages/hive-contracts run generate:ui`.
- Never commit `.env` files, keys, certificates, databases, or other credentials, or details of
  private infrastructure (real hostnames, IPs, usernames, home paths). The git hooks in `.githooks/`
  enforce this. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full rules, which apply to people and AI agents
  alike.
